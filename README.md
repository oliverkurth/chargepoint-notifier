Give a desktop notification when it's your turn to plug in

The Chargepoint web site will send you an email or SMS when it's you're turn to plug in,
but that's not working well when cell phone reception is bad and you don't watch your emails non-stop
while working on your desktop. By the time you notice, the spot may already have been given to somebody else.

This simple chrome extension will create a desktop notification when it's your turn to plug in, so you will
see it when working on something else.
